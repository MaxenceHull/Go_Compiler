Pineapple_release:
A few fixes: 
-> New array init (ex: 3*[0] instead of [0, 0, 0]
-> For loop inside switches (to handle break statements)
-> Bug concerning for loops inside a for loop
-> inequality between structs

Milestone 3:
Please consider for grading:
  -> programs/benchmarks/bubble_sort.go (Q1)
  -> programs/benchmarks/PrimeCounter.go (Q1)
  -> programs/code/test_arrays.go (Q2)
  -> programs/code/test_equals.go (Q2)
  -> programs/code/test_slices.go (Q2)
  -> programs/code/test_type_declaration.go (Q2)
  -> programs/code/test_var_declaration.go (Q2)
  
 
******PLEASE NOTE:
- Pretty Printer is not 100% Functional at the moment since we redid our grammar in AST form.
- you should probably add semicolons, as we still have some issues with these, we will probably need to come see you guys for help
- Issue with empty statements...
- the "{" brace must be on the same line as its associated block (I.E. func main() { instead of func main() \n { )
Thanks!!!
